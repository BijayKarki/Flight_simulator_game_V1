# Flight Simulator Game

Libraries used for the development: geopy, requests and mysql.connector

## Designed by group 4

## Description of the game

This is a pure character based game which runs on a Python terminal, originally developed for a school project.

The game utilizes a database which consists of information of airports around the world.
A player provides ICAO (one of the unique identifiers) of Airports to travel from one location to another while plying
the game.
The idea of the game is to travel from one location to another while collecting various weather targets.
A free weather API (https://open-meteo.com) was used to get the real-time weather conditions of the location where the
player is currently in.
The player wins the game if a set of weather targets are met while flying through various locations.

A mini-game inside the main game is implemented to make players aware on various topics of sustainability.
This allows the player to collect points which corresponds to the fuel for their flight.
